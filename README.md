# PhxCropperJs

A project demonstrating how to add cropper js to a phoenix liveview application.
I've intergrated open-cv using python through erlport. Only uploads that contain faces are allowed.

To Get started:  
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create `dev.local.exs` and add the path of your python interpretor use `dev.local.example` file to guide you.
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
